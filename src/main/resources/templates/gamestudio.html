					video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular
					board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of
					them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in
					each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and has been
					written for many computing platforms in use today. It has many
					variations and offshoots.</font>

					sizes, particularly the smaller 8-puzzle. If the size is 3×3 tiles,
					the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if 4×4 tiles,
					the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle named,
					respectively, for the number of tiles and the number of spaces. The
					object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making
					sliding moves that use the empty space..</font>
